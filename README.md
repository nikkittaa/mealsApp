# Meals App - React Native

## Overview

The **Meals App** is a simple mobile application built using React Native. It allows users to browse through a variety of meal categories and view detailed information about individual meals. Users can also mark meals as favorites and view them in a separate section dedicated to favorites.

## Features

1. **All Categories Screen**:
   - Displays a list of meal categories.
   - Clicking on a category shows all meals within that category.
   - Clicking on a meal provides detailed information such as ingredients, steps, and other relevant data.

2. **Favorites Screen**:
   - Displays a list of meals that the user has marked as favorites.
   - Favorites are managed using React's `useContext` hook to maintain global state across the app.
